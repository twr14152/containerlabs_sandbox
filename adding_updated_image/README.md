# Adding/upgrading image in docker/containerlab

 - This works but it can bring issues if you go to the latest and greatest. So docker pull image may be preferrable.
 - To build your own image follow steps 1, 2, 3.

 - Probably the recommended way to get a new image would be to just use docker pull. At least while your getting used to it.
   - docker pull frrouting/frr:latest
