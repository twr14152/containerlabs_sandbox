Notes/comments:

Reading the configs is pretty self explanatory. I find working with the show commands to be more tedious.

You will find info on layer 2 evpn in the following folder
- configs/l2-evpn 

**The other folders at this point are incomplete and potentially incorrect. I'll call out correct solns as I go and will post like the l2-evpn.
