Notes/comments:

Reading the configs is pretty self explanatory. I find working with the show commands to be more tedious.

Completed lab buildouts:
- Layer 2 evpn setup and info
  - configs/l2-evpn 






**The other folders with in configs folder at this point are incomplete and potentially incorrect. I'll call out correct solns as I go and will post like the l2-evpn.
