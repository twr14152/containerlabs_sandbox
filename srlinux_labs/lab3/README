Notes/comments:

- Reading the configs is pretty self explanatory. 
- Working with the show commands is more tedious than most NOS because of the way the models are applied to the command structure. 

Completed lab buildouts:
- Layer 2 evpn setup and info
  - configs/l2-evpn 






**The other folders within configs folder at this point are incomplete and potentially incorrect. I'll call out corrected solns as I go and will post like the l2-evpn.
