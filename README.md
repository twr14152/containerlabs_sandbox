# containerlabs_sandbox
- This repo will store store some labs as I mess around with this tool.
- Apple silicon has required me to go down this path.
- So far cEOS and FRR are my goto NOS right now
- With in couple of hours I've figured out how to use FRR in the way I was hoping to use cEOS.
- After some digging I found I was making too difficult to ssh into cEOS containerlab has that working out of the gates
- FRR is a much lighter performant image with my Mac M1.
- FRR/first_lab - basically just tested the routing and got ssh working
- ceos_labs/lab1 - first functional arista lab on this platform
